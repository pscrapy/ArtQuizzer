Website for randomized quiz on WGA art pieces

Bare-bones webpage for flashcard-like quiz on WGA art pieces: upon each refresh the artquiz.cgi fills the templated page with data for a randomly selected art piece.
By default the page displays only the art-piece image, the answer can be shown through a button toggle.

*Note*: the index.htm redirection should be edited to reflect the location of artquiz.cgi

There are probably better ways to achieve it but this does the job.
